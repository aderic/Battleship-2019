# Battleship-2019
A project I started during my time at The Software Guild. I completed this assignment sooner than the deadline, and to spice things up a bit I decided to implement a bot that you can play against.

### Dependencies
* .NET Framework 4.5
* NUnit 3.4.1

### Setup
The project Battleship.Tests depends on NUnit, you may be able to do an NUnit package restore, but if this doesn't work, you can install NUnit through the NuGet PM.
